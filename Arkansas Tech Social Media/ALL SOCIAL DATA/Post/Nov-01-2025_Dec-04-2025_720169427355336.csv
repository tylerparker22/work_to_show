Before the bright lights of the @nfl, there was Russellville, Arkansas. Before the roar of the crowd, there was a Wonder Boy who played for something bigger than himself.

Eddie Meador didn’t chase fame, he built it through heart, humility, and hard work that still echo through @arkansastech today.

He became a record-breaking @rams player. A leader. A legend.

And as today’s Wonder Boys pull on that same number, they don’t just wear his legacy, they carry it forward. @atuathletics 

🏈 It’s time for Eddie Meador’s name to live where it belongs… in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. @profootballhof
