I’ll never be able to put into words the impact you’ve had on my life. From the first day I stepped on this campus, I knew it wouldn’t be easy, but after completing my undergrad, I can say it was all worth it. Your campus may not be the biggest, but it’s the most beautiful, filled with the prettiest trees, friendly squirrels, the best campus ambassador @arkansastechjerry 🐾, and a community that makes this place so special.

I came to ATU as a stranger, and today I can confidently say it has become my home. After four major changes(yes,FOUR🫨), countless student organizations, endless campus tours, and the most meaningful connections, I couldn’t imagine myself graduating anywhere else. @arkansastech the beauty of your campus and community has shaped me into the leader I never knew I could become.

Back in 2019, I walked onto this campus as a little girl, and in 2024, I’m stepping out as a confident woman who has accomplished far more than she ever dreamed possible.

Thank you to @ztaarkansastech , @panhellenicatu , @atuorientation , @elevationrus , @orderzetasigma , @atuimsso , @atusga , @go2atu , @atu_techsluggers , 
@atu_cru , @atu_plc , and @atu_business for trusting me with incredible opportunities and contributing into my college career. The student organizations and leaders on this campus never cease to inspire me, and I can confidently say that anyone can become a leader at ATU.

ATU not only has amazing students but also the best mentors and professors. To all my mentors—thank you for pouring into me, believing in me, and always keeping your doors open for this big yapper right here. (Special shoutout to Meighan, Chelsea and Cody, Rhylie, Deidra, Kevin, Dr. Nichols, Kampi, Dr. Mason, Dr. Narcum, Mr. Pennington, Katie, Hailey, Brooke, KC, Ryan, Sara, and so many more .. I’ll carry your advice forever and ever 💚💛).

As I close this chapter, I’m overwhelmed with happiness and gratitude. Thank you for letting me be your Homecoming Queen 2022, my besties, & my new self who now steps through the big doors.

I love you, Arkansas Tech University. It’s an honor to officially be your alumna. Green and Gold Forever and Go Wonder Boys/Golden Suns🎓🥹♾️",0,"12/31/2024 16:37",https://www.instagram.com/p/DEQ1slYypRPYkbiYWc3F_yT4UWRwZgUjisLFSs0/,"IG carousel",,Lifetime,11343,919,0,79,0,,
