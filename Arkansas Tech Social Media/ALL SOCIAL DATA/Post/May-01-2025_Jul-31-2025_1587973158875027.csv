His advice for students looking for internships?
✅ Start early
✅ Don’t count yourself out
✅ Network and follow up

“A lot of internships are more about your willingness to learn and your attitude than your experience.”

Super proud of the work he accomplished this summer and the initiative it took to get there! 💚💛

Some of our students brought that tradition back this week because no matter how grown up we get, we never outgrow needing our moms.

To every mom, stepmom, grandma, aunt, and mother figure, we’re grateful for all the love you give. And with graduation just behind us, this one feels extra special. We know who helped get our grads here.

Tag your mom (or your biggest supporter) and tell her how much she means to you.

Happy Mother’s Day from all of us at the College of Business and Economic Development 💗
